# Google News RSS Feed Viewer
A news app based on the Google News RSS Feed. This provides the user with a listing of top news stories and the ability to tap on a particular news story to learn more.

## Additional Features
- A gradient across the bottom of each news story in the list to help denote to the user to tap for more information
- If no stories can be retrieved, then a "Refresh" button will appear allowing the user to try again

## Testing the App
1. Open the Xcode project and click on the Test navigator.
2. Click the play button next to "StoryTests".
This will run tests based on the 'Story' model to ensure that the XML is being manipulated properly. The project is set to Universal and has been tested on a physical iPhone 5.

## Supporting Assets

- A tailored launch image to give the illusion of gradually fading into the initial screen
